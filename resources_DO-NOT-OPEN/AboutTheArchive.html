<p> This tool enables students to quickly and easily access papers and mark schemes without a search engine, keep track of what they have completed, and update their teachers. It is well-organized, fast and ad-free. All papers are accessed from <a href="https://papers.gceguide.com"> papers.gceguide.com</a>. </p>

<p> <h3>Features and structure</h3> The site consists of a home page, as well as pages which can be accessed through links in the top menu. There are subpages for each subject and year, a 'Search' page, a 'Log' page, and an 'About' page, which you are currently viewing. The 'Home' page has a list of all the exam sessions and each subpage has links to individual papers.<br><br>

The <b>search feature</b> lets you select details of the specific paper or mark scheme you're looking for and generates a link to it. You have the option of marking the paper as done right there next to the search result itself.<br><br>

The <b>log feature</b> keeps track of the papers you mark as done (there is a button beside each link), and displays them all in one place, along with the date you marked them as done. You can download the log as a text file, which you could send to the teacher as an update. The log may not work on incognito windows, or if you clear history, and on certain browsers which don't store specific information. <a href="#browser" onclick="highlight()"><sup>see more</sup></a>.</p>

<p> Links to the above pages can be found on the bar at the top of the page, along with an option to report issues. 
<b> If you come across an issue, please report IMMEDIATELY</b> so it can be fixed. You need to report immediately since the site keeps a short record of your activity, which can help in pinpointing the cause of some problems. This record is deleted often, so for us to see it you should report anything asap. </p>

<p> The <b>paper codes</b>, such as "0680_m20_ms_23", contain all the information about that paper/mark scheme/insert. The first four digits are the 'subject code'. "0680" is the code for EM. The next three characters, e.g. "m20", stand for the exam series and year: "m" is for feb-<b>m</b>arch, "s" for may-june (<b>s</b>ummer), and "w" for october-november (<b>w</b>inter). The next two letters, either "qp", "ms" or "in", mean question paper, mark scheme and insert respectively. The last two numbers stand for the paper number and set, like paper 2 and set 3.</p>

<br><b>Please note</b>: It is crucial that no file within the "IGCSEpapers_Archive" folder is <i>moved <b>or</b> edited</i>, since even a single added or deleted character can potentially disable a feature. For this reason, it is best not to open any folder labeled 'DO-NOT-OPEN'.</p> 

<hr> <p id="browser"><b>Browser support:</b> The Archive has been tested and works fine on the latest Chrome for MacOS, the latest Chrome for Windows 10, and Safari 12.1, but some features are not supported by Firefox.</p>
