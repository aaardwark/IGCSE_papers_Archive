# IGCSE_papers_Archive
This tool enables students to quickly and easily access papers and mark schemes without using a search engine, keep track of what they have completed, and update their teachers. It is well-organized, fast and ad-free. All papers are accessed from papers.gceguide.com.
**This repo is retired as papers.gceguide.com has moved. All links generated are broken. Additionally, only papers from 2019 to 2022 are available, as the source has not been maintained.**

## Layout
The site consists of a home page, as well as pages which can be accessed through links in the top menu. There are subpages for each subject and year, a 'Search' page, a 'Log' page, and an 'About' page. The 'Home' page has a list of all the exam sessions and each subpage has links to individual papers.

## Features
### Search
The search feature lets you select details of the specific paper or mark scheme you're looking for and generates a link to it. You have the option of marking the paper as done right there next to the search result itself.
### Log
The log feature keeps track of the papers you mark as done (there is a button beside each link), and displays them all in one place, along with the date you marked them as done. You can download the log as a text file, which you could send to the teacher as an update. The log may not work on incognito windows, or if you clear history, and on certain browsers which don't store cookies.
Links to the above pages can be found on the bar at the top of the page. The site keeps a short record of your activity, which can help in pinpointing the cause of some problems. This record is overwritten continually.
## About paper codes
The paper codes, such as "0680_m20_ms_23", contain all the information about that paper/mark scheme/insert. The first four digits are the 'subject code'. "0680" is the code for EM. The next three characters, e.g. "m20", stand for the exam series and year: "m" is for feb-march, "s" for may-june (summer), and "w" for october-november (winter). The next two letters, either "qp", "ms" or "in", mean question paper, mark scheme and insert respectively. The last two numbers stand for the paper number and set, like paper 2 and set 3.
